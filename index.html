                    <h3>Mission</h3>
                    <p>Web developers are at the forefront of the Internet age. The websites we browse, the gifts we
                        order
                        and
                        the news we peruse online are all made possible by the web developers who design, build and
                        implement
                        Internet websites. They are heavily involved in website creation, from helping design aesthetic
                        properties such
                        as layout and color, to technical considerations such as how to design a website to handle a
                        given
                        amount
                        of Internet traffic.</p>
