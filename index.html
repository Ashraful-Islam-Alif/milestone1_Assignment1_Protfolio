                    <p>Web developers are at the forefront of the Internet age. The websites we browse, the gifts we
                        order
                        and
                        the news we peruse online are all made possible by the web developers who design, build and
                        implement
                        Internet websites. They are heavily involved in website creation, from helping design aesthetic
                        properties such
                        as layout and color, to technical considerations such as how to design a website to handle a
                        given
                        amount
                        of Internet traffic.</p>

                <p>The web development trends 2022 directly depend on the needs of users and their preferences.
                    Developers
                    are
                    directly related to these factors and select tools for creation based on this data. Based on trends
                    in
                    the
                    development and use of tools, I came to the conclusion that some of the methods will carry over from
                    this
                    year,
                    as they have not lost their relevance. Therefore, a number of main trends can be defined.</p>
